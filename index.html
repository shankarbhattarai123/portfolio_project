      <h2>My first job as the developer</h2><hr>
      <p>Breaking into the working scene can be daunting for fresh graduates these days. Companies prefer candidates with experience. Candidates need a job, more often than not to gain experience. This chicken-and-egg problem is an endless, vicious cycle that often asserts much-unneeded pressure on graduates or graduates-to-be.
        I can still remember how eager I was to finish my final semester and get the degree over and done with. It was as if yesterday I had graduated and begun job hunting. I had my CV and cover letter all ready to go. Application after application, I cast my net into the sea of technology companies.</p><hr>
